#### Security & Architecture Leadership
- Designed and implemented a scalable service-to-service security architecture using OAuth and AWS Cognito, supporting multi-environment isolation and long-term service growth
- Led cross-functional collaboration across Development, SecOps, and Architecture teams to define boundaries for environment segregation, scope design, and client management strategies
- Resolved Cognito client-scaling constraints by designing a scope-based authorization model using single-client-per-service patterns, preventing long-term platform limitations
- Refactored Terraform architecture to support evolving security requirements, including externalized configuration logic via Lambda integrations
- Delivered a security platform now supporting 30+ services across environments, establishing a durable foundation for service growth


### KEY IMPACT HIGHLIGHTS
- Reduced platform operational costs by >$70k/month through logging and storage optimization initiatives
